# Angular Material-Start (ES6 Tutorials)

This branch contains the same tutorial application created in master and the es5 branch... but this branch implements the application using JSPM and ES6. 

![material-starter-ux2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/210413/6448551/70864488-c0e0-11e4-8767-c4e1e4c2f343.png)

Above is a snaphot of the Starter-App with a **Master-Detail** layout: showing a list of users (left) and a user detail view (right). 

> There are no tutorial steps in this branch. <br/> Rather the finished application is published here for comparison and learning purposes. 

This sample application is purposed as both a learning tool and a skeleton application for a typical [AngularJS Material](http://angularjs.org/) ES6 web app: comprised of a Side navigation area and a content area. You can use it to quickly bootstrap your angular webapp projects and dev environment for these projects.

### Wirefame 

The illustration below shows how we planned the layout and identified the primary components that will be used in the Starter ap:

> Note: that container #2 (above) is a simple `<div>` container and not an Angular Material component.

### ES6 with JSPM

These application use jspm.io: package manager for SystemJS which is built on top of the dynamic ES6 module loader. This allows developers to load any module format (ES6, CommonJS, AMD, and globals).

After you have cloned the repository, you should execute the following commands:

* `npm install jspm -g`
* `jspm install`


Since web application uses **jspm** with Angular-Material:

* In the HTML, we only load the **System loader** and the configuration module
> Notice no stylesheets are loaded here... they are injected later upon demand
* Configure the system loader to load the app/boot module.
